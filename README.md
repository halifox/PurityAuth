## üé® Design Guidelines

### 1. **Simplicity**

- The interface should remain clean and avoid excessive decoration and redundant elements.
- Each interface element should have a clear function and purpose, minimizing unnecessary distractions.

### 2. **Consistency**

- Ensure that global elements (such as buttons, icons, colors, fonts, etc.) remain consistent across different interfaces and states, enhancing user familiarity and trust.

### 3. **Contrast**

- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background to improve readability.
- Pay special attention to color-blind users by avoiding information conveyance through color alone, and appropriately use text or icons for additional clarification.

### 4. **Color Standards**

- Use a limited primary color palette to build the interface, avoiding excessive colors that distract users.
- Complement with neutral tones (such as gray, black, white) to highlight important content.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast between important actions (such as buttons, links) and regular content.
- Use dynamic color schemes (such as Android's dynamic colors) to ensure compatibility and consistency across different system themes.

### 5. **Typography Standards**

- Choose readable fonts, such as system default fonts (like Roboto, San Francisco) or other common web fonts.
- Use appropriate font sizes and line spacing to ensure text readability.
- Text elements such as titles, body text, and buttons should use clearly hierarchical font sizes to enhance interface usability and content hierarchy.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

Q1: I lost my device. How can I recover 2FA? ü§î  
A1: If you have lost your device or cannot access saved 2FA codes, you will need to use backup keys or contact the relevant service provider for account recovery. Please ensure you saved backup keys when enabling 2FA.üîë

Q2: How can I ensure my 2FA codes are secure? üîí  
A2: Since this tool operates completely offline and does not send any information to servers, your 2FA codes are stored only on your local device. For enhanced security, we recommend using a strong password to lock your device and regularly backing up your keys.üíº

Q3: Can I use this tool on multiple devices? üì±üíª  
A3: Currently, this tool does not support synchronization functionality, so 2FA codes and account information are stored locally on each device. If you need to use it on multiple devices, please set it up separately on each device.üîÑ

Q4: Why do I always see expired verification codes? ‚è≥   
A4: 2FA codes are time-based and update every 30 seconds. Ensure you enter the code before it expires. If the code times out, please wait for a new code to be generated.‚åõ
